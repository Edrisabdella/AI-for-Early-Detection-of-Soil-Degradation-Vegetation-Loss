## 🌱 Overview

Land degradation and vegetation loss are urgent global challenges that threaten ecosystems, food security, and climate stability.  
This project applies **Artificial Intelligence**, **Remote Sensing**, and **Geospatial Analysis** to **detect early signs** of soil degradation and vegetation stress.

By integrating **satellite imagery**, **machine learning**, and **environmental indicators**, the system enables **real-time monitoring** and **decision support** for sustainable land management — initially in **Ethiopia and East Africa**, and scalable globally.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

- Over **25% of global land** is degraded due to erosion, poor land use, and deforestation.  
- In **Ethiopia and East Africa**, millions of hectares of fertile land are at risk.  
- Traditional land assessment methods are **manual, time-consuming**, and **reactive**.  
- There’s a lack of **AI-driven, accessible, and automated systems** for early detection of soil degradation and vegetation loss.  

This project bridges that gap through a **data-driven, AI-powered detection platform**.

---

## 💡 Solution

The **Early Detection of Soil Degradation and Vegetation Loss System** is an AI platform that analyzes remote sensing data to:

- Detect early signs of land degradation.
- Predict vegetation decline trends.
- Provide actionable insights for governments, NGOs, and farmers.

### Key Capabilities

1. **AI-Powered Image Classification** — Identifies degradation zones using NDVI and multispectral imagery.  
2. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard** — Interactive GIS dashboard for land health visualization.  
3. **Predictive Analytics** — Machine learning models forecast future degradation patterns.  
4. **Open Access API** — Enables integration with research, policy, and community applications.

## 🌳 Environmental Context

### Causes of Natural Resource Degradation

- Deforestation and overgrazing  
- Unsustainable farming and urbanization  
- Poor soil management and climate stress  

### Effects

- Decline in crop yield and biodiversity  
- Water scarcity and desertification  
- Increased vulnerability to climate shocks  

### Major Soils in Ethiopia & East Africa

- **Nitisols**, **Vertisols**, **Acrisols**, and **Andosols** — fertile but erosion-prone.  

### Slope & Climate

- Steeper slopes and high rainfall accelerate erosion and degradation.  

---

## 🌍 Impact of Land Use and Degradation

Uncontrolled deforestation and conversion of natural habitats to farmland lead to **severe soil erosion** and **vegetation decline**, threatening long-term sustainability.

---

## 🧱 Response Measures

### Physical Measures

- Terracing, reforestation, bunds, and soil conservation.

### Technological Measures

- GIS and remote sensing–based monitoring.  
- AI-powered early detection for proactive intervention.  

---

## 🇪🇹 Status in Ethiopia & East Africa

- Over **27 million hectares** degraded.
